## Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the project structure to help you find your way around:

-   `src/lib/scenes/scene.ts`: The heart of the application. All Three.js logic, including object creation, rendering, and interaction, lives here.
-   `src/lib/physics/biotSavart.ts`: Contains the core physics formulas used to calculate the magnetic fields.
-   `src/lib/components/`: Contains all the Svelte components that make up the UI.
    -   `shared/`: Reusable components like sliders, buttons, and the header.
    -   Other files are the main UI panels.
-   `src/lib/stores/`: Svelte stores for managing global state, such as the active theme and the current simulation.
-   `src/routes/`: Defines the pages of the application, following the SvelteKit routing conventions.

## Code Style Guide

This project uses **Prettier** for code formatting and **ESLint** for linting to maintain a consistent code style.

-   Before committing your changes, please run the formatter:
    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```
-   You can also check for any linting errors with:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
