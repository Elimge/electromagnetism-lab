			"p1": "The Biot-Savart law is used to compute the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current. It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current.",
			"p2": "This law is fundamental in magnetostatics, playing a role similar to that of Coulomb's law in electrostatics."
